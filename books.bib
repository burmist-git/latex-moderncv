abstract = {Bioinformatics Algorithms: an Active Learning Approach is one of the first textbooks to emerge from the recent Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) revolution. A light-hearted and analogy-filled companion to the authors{\textquoteright} acclaimed Bioinformatics Specialization on Coursera, this book presents students with a dynamic approach to learning bioinformatics. It strikes a unique balance between practical challenges in modern biology and fundamental algorithmic ideas, thus capturing the interest of students of both biology and computer science.
Each chapter begins with a biological question, such as {\textquotedblleft}Are There Fragile Regions in the Human Genome?{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}Which DNA Patterns Play the Role of Molecular Clocks?{\textquotedblright} and then steadily develops the algorithmic sophistication required to answer this question. Hundreds of exercises are incorporated directly into the text as soon as they are needed; readers can test their knowledge through automated coding challenges on the Rosalind Bioinformatics Textbook Track.},
